- **2)** W(n) = 2 + W(n-1) + W(n-2), total work between O(2^n) and O(sqrt(2)^n)

- **3)** S(n âˆ’ 1) + c, and the Span is 

- **4)** The "count" array shows how many time each Fibonacci number is computed. The pattern demonstrates that there is much duplicate work being done in the computation.

- **6)** The maximum number of times it will be called is 1 time. The span and work are both O(n)


- **8)** The maximum times F_i will get read is 2 times. The work and span for the bottom-up function would be O(n)
